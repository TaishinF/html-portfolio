<h1>The Best Movies According to Taishin</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>1. Shoplifters</h3>
<p>This is my favorite Japanese film by Hirokazu Kore-eda. 
    The theme of this movie is modern Japanese society and family. 
    This movie makes us seriously think about the hidden dark side of modern Japan. </p> 
    
<h3>2. My Tomorrow, Your Yesterday</h3>
<p>This is a Japanese romantic drama film I really recommend to you.</p>

<h3>3. Yes Man</h3>
<p>This must be the best romantic comedy film from the US. I really recommend it.</p>
